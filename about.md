## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/profile.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Ayush Goel and I am a second year Computer Science and Computational Mathematics student at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu). I am also part of [Computer Science House](https://www.csh.rit.edu/), an organization dedicated towards helping students grow through hands-on learning and social environment.
